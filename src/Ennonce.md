Write the following methods that return a lambda expression performing a specified action:

1.    PerformOperation isOdd(): 
    The lambda expression must return true if a number is odd or false if it is even.
2.    PerformOperation isPrime(): 
    The lambda expression must return true if a number is prime or false if it is composite.
3.    PerformOperation isPalindrome(): 
    The lambda expression must return true if a number is a palindrome or false if it is not.
      

# Sample Input

The first line contains an integer, (the number of test cases).

The subsequent lines each describe a test case in the form of space-separated integers:
The first integer specifies the condition to check for ( for Odd/Even, for Prime, or for Palindrome).
The second integer denotes the number to be checked.
